      <p>
        This is an article about writing vectors in C99 (aka dynamic arrays).
        We're doing this for the fun of it, to see what can be done with the C
        language, and to get to take a look at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming"
          >Generic Programming</a
        >
        in such a simple setting like C provides.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll implement vectors in C with a combination of preprocessor macros
        and some clever memory layouting, with a trick that I first learnt from

        You can skip ahead directly to the
        <a href="#implementing-the-vector">vector implementation part</a> of the
        text if you want, as I will start by showing off an example usage of the
        vector and then give some background on generic programming and
        parameterized types.

      <h3>What's a vector?</h3>

      <p>
        A dynamic array is called a Vector in C++ and Rust, and is called an
        ArrayList in Java and C#. In scripting languages like Python and
        JavaScript, all arrays are dynamic, but in C we ordinarily only have
        access to fixed size arrays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vectors are arrays that can grow and shrink in size as elements are
        added and removed from them, by storing the elements in heap memory and
        re-allocating that memory when needed, instead of storing the items in a
        fixed sized array in stack memory.
      </p>

      <h2>I. Example of using vectors in C</h2>
      <p>
        Let's begin by taking a look at how vectors can be used in a simple C
        program, so we get a sense of the thing we're going to build.
      </p>

      <p>
        This program takes a list of integers as argument on the command line
        and prints their average to stdout. The program consists of three
        functions; <code>parse_numbers</code>, <code>compute_average</code> and
        <code>main</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <code>parse_numbers</code> function takes an array of strings and
        parses them into numbers and pushes them into a newly constructed
        vector, which is then returned to the caller. The
        <code>vec_t(long)</code> type acts like a <code>long[]</code> array, but
        is able to hold any amount of <code>long</code> values (error checking
        omitted for brevity).
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">vec_t(long) parse_numbers(const char* strings[], size_t num_strings) {
    vec_t(long) numbers = vec_new(long);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < num_strings; i++) {
        long number = strtol(strings[i], NULL, 10);
        vec_push(numbers, number);
    }

    return numbers;
}</code></pre>

      <aside class="callout">
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Already here we can notice that we'll be
          putting preprocessor macros into use. The expressions
          <code>vec_t()</code>, <code>vec_new()</code>, and
          <code>vec_push()</code> will turn out to be macros.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        Once the input has been parsed, we can take the numbers and compute
        their average with the
        <code>compute_average</code> function, which takes a
        <code>vector</code> as argument and then returns the average as a float.
      </p>

      <p>
        The elements are accessed with the <code>[]</code> bracket operator,
        just like you would an ordinary array, in the expression
        <code>numbers[i]</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">float compute_average(vec_t(long) numbers) {
    float sum = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < vec_size(numbers); i++) {
        sum += numbers[i];
    }

    return sum / vec_size(numbers);
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        These two functions are then be applied in the
        <code>main</code> function. The user input from stdin is passed into
        <code>parse_numbers</code> (skipping this first argument since that is
        just the executable name), and the average is then computed and printed
        to stdout. Finally, the vector is freed with <code>vec_free()</code>.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-c">int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    vec_t(long) numbers = parse_numbers(argc - 1, argv + 1);

    float average = compute_average(numbers);
    printf("%.2f\n", average);

    vec_free(numbers);
    return 0;
}</code></pre>

      <p>Running this program gives the following ouput:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-none">> ./average 14 16 20
16.67
</code></pre>

      <h2>II. Vectors and Generic Programming</h2>
      <p>
        In this section will take a closer look at what's going on with the
        expression <code>vec_t(long)</code>, where the typename
        <code>long</code> appears as argument to another type
        <code>vec_t</code>, and how types like <code>vec_t</code> can be used to
        write re-usable code in a programming style called generic programming.
      </p>

      <h3>List sorting</h3>
      <p>
        In the scripting language
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)"
          >Lisp</a
        >
        , the primary data structure used is a <em>list</em>. The language comes
        with many functions that operate on lists, like sorting and searching,
        that work for <em>any</em>
        lists no matter what items it contains, which allow for those functions
        to be re-used in many different kinds of programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lists in Lisp are written e.g.
        <code>'(3 1 2)</code> or <code>'("bob" "charlie" "alice")</code>. These
        lists can then be sorted with the <code>sort</code> function. Both
        <code>#'<</code> and <code>#'string<</code> are less-than-operators, and
        are used as sorting predicates:
      </p>

      <pre><code class="language-lisp">(print (sort '(3 1 2) #'<))
(print (sort '("bob" "charlie" "alice") #'string<))
</code></pre>

      <p>Running the above program gives:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-none">> ./sorting_program
(1 2 3)
("alice" "bob" "charlie")</code></pre>

      <p>
        Both lists were sorted with the same function <code>sort</code>, which
        means once the <code>sort</code> function has been written, we can
        re-use it for any kind of list we might need.
      </p>

      <h3>Pointers and arrays are parameterized types</h3>
      <p>
        When writing C programs, we're used to working with types like
        <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, enum types and struct types etc.
        In addition to these we also have <em>pointer types</em> like
        <code>int*</code>, <code>float*</code> and <em>array types</em> like
        <code>int[]</code> and <code>float[]</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's particular about these latter two kinds of types is that we have
        two components:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>a type name like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code></li>
        <li>the asterix <code>*</code> or bracket <code>[]</code> suffix</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both pointers and arrays are examples of <em>parameterized types</em>,
        meaning that we have a type that act like a <em>function</em> from a
        type to a type; they take a type as argument and then return a concrete
        type back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Parameterized types allow us to write <em>generic functions</em> that
        allow a statically typed langauge to write functions that are flexible
        like <code>sort</code> is in Lisp.
      </p>

      <h3>Functions operating on parameterized types</h3>
      <p>
        In a typed programming language, functions are defined with parameters
        of some known types, and with a known return type. To write a function
        like the Lisp `sort` function, however, we'd need to be able to
        <em>generalize</em> functions with type parameters, just like
        <code>vec_t</code> takes a type parameter.
